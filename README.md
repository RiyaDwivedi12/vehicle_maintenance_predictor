Vehicle Maintenance Predictor

This is a Machine Learning based web app built with Streamlit that predicts whether a vehicle requires maintenance or not based on various input parameters. The model used here is a Decision Tree Classifier, trained on vehicle maintenance data.

Project Overview
The Vehicle Maintenance Predictor helps users estimate the condition of a vehicle and predict whether maintenance is needed.
This project demonstrates the use of:

* Machine Learning (Decision Tree)
* Model Deployment using Streamlit
* Python (pandas, scikit-learn, numpy)

Tech Stack

* Python
* Streamlit – for frontend web interface
* Scikit-learn – for building the machine learning model
* Pandas – for data manipulation
* NumPy – for numerical operations
